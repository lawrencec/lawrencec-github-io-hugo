Yet another rss app but it shows nicely the usage of various components, old and new, that 2004 offers.
It uses the Accordion and TextArea UIComponents and the XMLConnector to load the urls of the feeds to download. Flash&amp;rsquo;s css support is also demostrated within the textarea.</description></item><item><title>Design Patterns in Flash</title><link>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/design-patterns-in-flash/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2003 17:20:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/design-patterns-in-flash/</guid><description>Now Actionscript is OO, I thought it would be useful to try out implementing a design pattern in Flash.

An interface is an object that defines methods but has no implementation.</description></item><item><title> Flash TvGuide App</title><link>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/flash-tvguide-app/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2003 14:53:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/flash-tvguide-app/</guid><description>Okay, heres the flash client (only 47k!) for the TVguide webservice posted recently.
It&amp;rsquo;s quite a fairly simple movie using flash remoting and amfphp. I used amf to call my tvguide webservice via SOAP. Instead of having your swf call a specifc flash service, you call a special service which acts like a proxy to SOAP webservices. This service looks like this..
1// AMFPHP uses by default the PEAR::SOAP 2// library, so you need to define in the 3// gateway not to use that.</description></item><item><title>Webservices in Flash 2004</title><link>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/webservices-in-flash-2004/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2003 18:10:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/webservices-in-flash-2004/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing about with the webservice connector in flash mx 2004. What I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered is that connecting to a webservice and using the data returned is really easy.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the tvGuide webservice (http://www.nodetraveller.com/webservices/tvGuide/tvGuideService.php?wsdl here at nodetraveller.com as one of the operations it provides is a list of channels which would look ideal in a listbox.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick guide to using a webservice:
