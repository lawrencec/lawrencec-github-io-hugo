Looking through the cobwebs of my old laptop backups,I (re)discovered my old DHTML newsfeeds mini-app. This app lists all newsfeeds from [moreover.com](http://www.moreover.com/) and provides a user interface to view the feeds and store favourite feeds and it does this without reloading the whole pages so it can be a component within a page rather than a page in itself. You can see it [here ](http://www.nodetraveller.com/dhtml/newsfeeds/NewsFeeds.html)or download [here](http://www.nodetraveller.com/downloads/newsfeeds.zip).

It loads the data via javascript though I did have an xml version but that one didn't survive...In fact I'm not sure how much longer moreover.com will support the js feeds so this may be dead in the water pretty soon or it may not...

Btw,it should work on IE5.5, IE6 and all Mozilla browsers though I remember problems with Netscape 6.x so its fairly cross-browser...

**Why the glacial delay?**The various components in this app were coded between late 2000 and late summer 2001 but I lost touch with it for various reasons (including my then employer pushing me out of DHTML and into Java and a serious hard drive crash around the same time). Now I'm not the best organised guy in the world and though I used to make backups, in those days, I'd forget where I put them. Hence this lost script. I recently looked thru my backups for some old information I needed and to my delight I found this script.

I tidied up the code and now provide the whole script here or if you like each component separately.
