Recently I've been working on a webservice using PHP and [nusoap](http://dietrich.ganx4.com/nusoap/index.php). It provides information about 41 UK TV and radio programming schedule for the upcoming week.

The wsdl can be found [here ](http://www.nodetraveller.com/webservices/tvGuide/tvGuideService.php?wsdl)and example php client [here](http://www.nodetraveller.com/webservices/tvGuide/tvGuideClient.php).

I'm just finishing the final touches to a flash client which I'll be posting sometime within the next couple days. Hopefully this will show how to use the webservice in your flash apps..
