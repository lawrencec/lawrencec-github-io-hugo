I've been a bit busy over the last week or so and haven't had time to do post anything or even read ppls blogs. But I had a rather pleasant surprise when I caught up on my reading and found Mario Klingmann at Quasimondo had mentioned this site on his blog! Very nice indeed! Thanks Mario...

I've got a few flash projects in the pipeline that I'm hoping to find the time to work on. When I do, I'll expect to post a bit more frequently.....
