This may be a few months old but I only just discovered it. This [article ](http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/usability_heuristics_for_rich_internet_applications.php)discusses Jakobs Nielsen 1994 usability heuristics for desktop applications with respect to Rich Internet Applications. Most of us might be used to website heuristics but RIAs are more like desktop applications and should be treated similarly and the article explains how.
