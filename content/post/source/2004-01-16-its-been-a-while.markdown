..since I've posted. I've been busy with a couple of projects and haven't had much time. These projects were Java and PHP based with pure HTML frontends but could probably be enhanced quite nicely if using Flash. I'll probably add this to my list of things to do with Flash. Lately this list of mine is getting longer; either my creative think tank juices are overflowing or there's never enough time.

Having said, things have eased up somewhat though and I'm hoping to squeeze some time in to look at Central. It's been near the top of my list for a while and it looks like fun....If I get the time to really get into it, I'll let you know how I get on...
