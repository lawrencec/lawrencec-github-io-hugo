I've been using an opensource CMS application recently called [Mambo](http://www.mamboserver.com/).

We needed some kind of CMS for our own site and after looking around, weren't really happy with what was out there..

The sites based on *nuke seem so chaotic. But not Mambo. The sites created with Mambo are nicely designed and user friendly. But the admin interface is absolutely brilliant! Its a well designed system with a great community. Theres quite a few templates around which quite nice to look at. Also there are some components and modules around which are actually useful for non-community sites.

If you need a nice CMS and more, take a look...and prepare to dance...
