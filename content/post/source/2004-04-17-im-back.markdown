I knew I hadn't posted in a while but I didn't realise it's been almost 3 months! What have I been up to?!

I've been doing a lot of work with Mambo recently and I like the thing so much I think I'm going to be moving the backend of this blog form Movable Type to Mambo. The main reason for this is that I'll need to put up a version of Mambo up anyway to demo the things I've been working on, so I might as well use it to blog as well. Also any features that Mambo doesn't have or I don't like, I can add it myself, someting I couldn't do quickly with MT as I don't know much perl.

So quite soon, hopefully within two weeks, this site will change quite a bit. After that I should have more time to blog about what I'm up to....
