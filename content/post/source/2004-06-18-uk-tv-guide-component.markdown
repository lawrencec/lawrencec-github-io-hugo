I've just completed a component for [Mambo](http://www.mamboserver.com/). As you can probably guess by the name, it retreives and displays the TV and Radio listings for the UK. At the moment, there is a choice of over 60 channels and two ways of displaying the listings; columns and timeline.

I spent a bit more time on the UI than normal but finally I'm pleased with it. It works using XML RPC, connecting to my service and then displaying the listings. I hope to post more about the XML RPC service soon but I need to finish off a project before I do...

Anyway, click the link in the  menu and take a look. You can also download the component <del>here from this site</del> or from [mamboforge](http://mamboforge.net/projects/uktvguide/).
