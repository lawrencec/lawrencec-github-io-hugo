I was a bit disappointed with the standard rss feature in Mambo as it only supports rss 0.91. Suprisingly, there wasn't a component available that outputs the content in any of the other formats so I thought I'd give it a go. No point in reinventing the wheel so I made use of an excellent class called [FeedCreator](http://www.bitfolge.de/rsscreator-en.html). It can output in RSS 0.91, 1.0 and 2.0 as well as [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) and [ATOM 0.3](http://www.atomenabled.org/).

Also supplied is a module that will display the links. The actual links are configurable, in that you can specify what formats your feeds are in (Take a look on the right). Also you can add custom links and images with the module eg the mamboserver.com link is a custom one.

You can download it at [mamboforge](http://mamboforge.net/projects/rssxt/) <del>or from the my downloads section</del>

[Update]I've released a beta version of RSSXT 2. New features include remote blogging and pinging of aggregator sites. You can download it at the [mamboforge](http://mamboforge.net/projects/rssxt/) site
