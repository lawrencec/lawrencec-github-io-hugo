My latest project www.syntv.com is just about finished and is now out on a public beta.

SynTV provides UK TV listings in syndication formats (RSS 2.0 and ATOM) for use with desktop feed aggregators. Users can generate their own specific categories and searches and site developers are also provided for with support for HTML and Javascript.  In a couple of weeks, I'll also publish the XMLRPC web service.

If you're interested, please check it out and give me some feedback...
