I've moved my blog from [Mambo](http://www.mamboserver.com) to [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org). Mambo is a great CMS but as a blogging tool, its not quite so mature. I wanted something simple and web standards friendly and wordpress seems to be it. The casualties in this move are the comments and the uk tv guide. I'm no longer publishing the component as its a Mambo component. but head on over to [SynTV](http://www.syntv.com) for the listings. Fortunately I haven't blogged too much over and I was able to transfer over by good old cut n paste.

Well, there you go... expect some weird stuff as I play around and hopefully I'll post new content soon...
