Tim Huegdon has a great post about a really rather sweet piece of code called [AjaxEvent](http://nefariousdesigns.co.uk/archive/2007/07/ajaxevent-using-yui-custom-events-with-ajax/) over at his site, [nefariousdesigns](http://nefariousdesigns.co.uk). Developed with Mark Aidan Thomas, AjaxEvent is an object that wraps around the [YUI Connection](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/) and [CustomEvents](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/#customevent) that makes managing multiple, distinct ajax calls really easy.
