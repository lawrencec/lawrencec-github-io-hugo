Karma is written and supported by the Angular guys and in the year or so since this post was originally written has matured more than testem. I have a karma skeleton project that I use to setup my frontend testing environment. The readme for that project is pretty extensive and outlines how to set up a karma project.</description></item><item><title>Creating js files with Rhino (from JSON)</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/creating-js-files-with-rhino-from-json/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2007 23:41:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/creating-js-files-with-rhino-from-json/</guid><description>(This is primarily a note to myself)
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with Rhino. Specifically, reading in json objects, turning that into normal, runnable objects and saving that to a file so browsers can run it. More specifically, the code that transforms the JSON to an object in the browser should be exactly the same as the one that runs in Rhino. That way I don&amp;rsquo;t have to maintain two different versions.</description></item><item><title>ActsAsUndoable</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/actasundo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2007 09:04:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/actasundo/</guid><description>With web apps becoming more and more like Desktop apps, it seems like user interfaces need be more like desktop user interfaces too. Some of these web apps can have a complex UI and their users need to be able to feel comfortable with it. Of course, making the UI as simple as possible is key, but if a task is relatively complex then the UI will also be relatively complex.</description></item><item><title>AjaxEvent</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/ajaxevent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2007 21:25:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/ajaxevent/</guid><description>Tim Huegdon has a great post about a really rather sweet piece of code called AjaxEvent over at his site, nefariousdesigns.

I&amp;rsquo;ve made yet another tabbed interface widgety thing (like the &amp;lsquo;tubes needs another one) that uses AOP to add additonal features. A tabbed interface widget provided a nice problem for me to experiment with AOP. You can see the results which allows tabs in a widget to be draggable and closeable too.</description></item><item><title>JS Fun</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/js-fun/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2007 20:01:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/js-fun/</guid><description>For the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with different design patterns and methodologies in Javascript. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at the Composite pattern and also Aspects Oriented Programming (AOP).
AOP is a way of changing the behaviour of existing code without modifying it. It does this by providing, what AOP calls, advice at certain join points. In plain english, it provides a way of adding additional behaviour (advice) at certain points in your program (join points).</description></item><item><title>Howdy..</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/howdy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2006 12:01:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/howdy/</guid><description>Hey.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while.

But feel like posting again so I&amp;rsquo;ve changed servers and got a temp design up, which will change soon.

The bug in Opera 7.54u2 turned out to be rather strange. Any opera browser below 7.6 uses an iframe and I check the html within the frame to see if it is loaded. I use the text as that is the root node. In 7.54u2, there is no , only . Strange. Anyway I introduced a check for that and it works okay now.</description></item><item><title>LiveInfo Update</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/liveinfo-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2005 18:48:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/liveinfo-update/</guid><description>Just a minor update release on LiveInfo.

Here&amp;rsquo;s a gentle intro to the semantic web.
The semantic web won&amp;rsquo;t be in wide use yet but the University of Southhampton has released an interface to a new semantic web interface called mSpace. They have an example interface searching for classical music which currently is Mozilla only. It is javascript driven and uses xmlhttprequest to retrieve the data.</description></item><item><title>Introducing LiveInfo..</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/introducing-liveinfo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2005 15:46:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/introducing-liveinfo/</guid><description>Directly evolved from liveSearch, is a updated version which I&amp;rsquo;m calling liveInfo. As can be seen at chregu&amp;rsquo;s blog LiveSearch displays live search results while a user enters the search text. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen Google Suggest which uses the same technology (XMLHTTPRequest).
One of the coolest things about liveSearch is the keyboard navigation where users, when the input field has the focus, the user can navigate through the results using the up and down keys on the keyboard.</description></item><item><title>LiveInfo - How it works</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/liveinfo-how-it-works/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2005 15:42:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/liveinfo-how-it-works/</guid><description>LiveInfo is directly evolved from Livesearch. If you donâ€™t know what liveSearch is, liveSearch allowed users to search a website while still viewing the current page. The original can be seen here. Wanting to make use of liveSearch for one of my own projects, I proceeded to make some changes from which evolved LiveInfo. LiveInfo is a framework for multiple, real time, skinnable updatable elements within a web page. You can see LiveInfo in action on my blog where there are two LiveInfo elements.</description></item><item><title>Unobstrusive Javascript</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/unobstrusive-javascript/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2005 16:30:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/unobstrusive-javascript/</guid><description>An excellent article with examples of the correct way to do javascript.</description></item><item><title>A change...</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/a-change/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2005 21:44:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/a-change/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve moved my blog from Mambo to Wordpress. Mambo is a great CMS but as a blogging tool, its not quite so mature. I wanted something simple and web standards friendly and wordpress seems to be it. The casualties in this move are the comments and the uk tv guide. I&amp;rsquo;m no longer publishing the component as its a Mambo component. but head on over to SynTV for the listings. Fortunately I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged too much over and I was able to transfer over by good old cut n paste.</description></item><item><title>SynTV - Public Beta</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/syntv-public-beta/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2004 16:20:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/syntv-public-beta/</guid><description>My latest project www.syntv.com is just about finished and is now out on a public beta.
SynTV provides UK TV listings in syndication formats (RSS 2.0 and ATOM) for use with desktop feed aggregators. Users can generate their own specific categories and searches and site developers are also provided for with support for HTML and Javascript. In a couple of weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ll also publish the XMLRPC web service.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, please check it out and give me some feedback&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>UK TV Listings via XMLRPC</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/uk-tv-listings-via-xmlrpc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2004 20:58:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/uk-tv-listings-via-xmlrpc/</guid><description>The UK TV Guide for Mambo component is basically a XML RPC client thats talks to the XML RPC server here at nodetraveller.com and renders the data it gets back in a nice way.

Suprisingly, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a component available that outputs the content in any of the other formats so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a go. No point in reinventing the wheel so I made use of an excellent class called FeedCreator. It can output in RSS 0.91, 1.0 and 2.0 as well as OPML and ATOM 0.</description></item><item><title> UK TV Guide Component</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/uk-tv-guide-component/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2004 15:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/uk-tv-guide-component/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just completed a component for Mambo. As you can probably guess by the name, it retreives and displays the TV and Radio listings for the UK. At the moment, there is a choice of over 60 channels and two ways of displaying the listings; columns and timeline.
I spent a bit more time on the UI than normal but finally I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with it. It works using XML RPC, connecting to my service and then displaying the listings.</description></item><item><title>I'm back!</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/im-back/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2004 16:24:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/im-back/</guid><description>I knew I hadn&amp;rsquo;t posted in a while but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise it&amp;rsquo;s been almost 3 months! What have I been up to?!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of work with Mambo recently and I like the thing so much I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to be moving the backend of this blog form Movable Type to Mambo. The main reason for this is that I&amp;rsquo;ll need to put up a version of Mambo up anyway to demo the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, so I might as well use it to blog as well.</description></item><item><title> Get your dancing shoes on..</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/get-your-dancing-shoes-on/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2004 15:06:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/get-your-dancing-shoes-on/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using an opensource CMS application recently called Mambo.
We needed some kind of CMS for our own site and after looking around, weren&amp;rsquo;t really happy with what was out there..
The sites based on *nuke seem so chaotic. But not Mambo. The sites created with Mambo are nicely designed and user friendly. But the admin interface is absolutely brilliant! Its a well designed system with a great community. Theres quite a few templates around which quite nice to look at.</description></item><item><title> It's been a while...</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/its-been-a-while/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2004 16:24:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/its-been-a-while/</guid><description>..since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted. I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with a couple of projects and haven&amp;rsquo;t had much time. These projects were Java and PHP based with pure HTML frontends but could probably be enhanced quite nicely if using Flash. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add this to my list of things to do with Flash. Lately this list of mine is getting longer; either my creative think tank juices are overflowing or there&amp;rsquo;s never enough time.</description></item><item><title>Usability for RIAs</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/usability-for-rias/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2003 16:26:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/usability-for-rias/</guid><description>This may be a few months old but I only just discovered it.

Yet another rss app but it shows nicely the usage of various components, old and new, that 2004 offers.
It uses the Accordion and TextArea UIComponents and the XMLConnector to load the urls of the feeds to download.

The pattern I chose is the Memento pattern, which is mainly used to implement &amp;ldquo;undo&amp;rdquo; functionality in applications. The reason I chose Memento is because its a pattern that uses interfaces and I wanted to explore this in AS 2.0. An interface is an object that defines methods but has no implementation.</description></item><item><title> Flash TvGuide App</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/flash-tvguide-app/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2003 14:53:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/flash-tvguide-app/</guid><description>Okay, heres the flash client (only 47k!) for the TVguide webservice posted recently.
It&amp;rsquo;s quite a fairly simple movie using flash remoting and amfphp. I used amf to call my tvguide webservice via SOAP. Instead of having your swf call a specifc flash service, you call a special service which acts like a proxy to SOAP webservices. This service looks like this..
1// AMFPHP uses by default the PEAR::SOAP 2// library, so you need to define in the 3// gateway not to use that.</description></item><item><title> UK TV Guide Webservice</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/uk-tv-guide-webservice/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2003 15:08:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/uk-tv-guide-webservice/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a webservice using PHP and nusoap.
