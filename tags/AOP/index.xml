I&amp;rsquo;ve made yet another tabbed interface widgety thing (like the &amp;lsquo;tubes needs another one) that uses AOP to add additonal features. A tabbed interface widget provided a nice problem for me to experiment with AOP. You can see the results which allows tabs in a widget to be draggable and closeable too.</description></item><item><title>JS Fun</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/js-fun/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2007 20:01:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/js-fun/</guid><description>For the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with different design patterns and methodologies in Javascript. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at the Composite pattern and also Aspects Oriented Programming (AOP).
AOP is a way of changing the behaviour of existing code without modifying it. It does this by providing, what AOP calls, advice at certain join points. In plain english, it provides a way of adding additional behaviour (advice) at certain points in your program (join points).</description></item></channel></rss>
