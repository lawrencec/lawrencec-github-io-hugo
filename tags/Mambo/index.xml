Mambo is a great CMS but as a blogging tool, its not quite so mature. I wanted something simple and web standards friendly and wordpress seems to be it. The casualties in this move are the comments and the uk tv guide. I&amp;rsquo;m no longer publishing the component as its a Mambo component. but head on over to SynTV for the listings. Fortunately I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged too much over and I was able to transfer over by good old cut n paste.</description></item><item><title>RSS options in Mambo</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/rss-options-in-mambo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2004 14:29:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/rss-options-in-mambo/</guid><description>I was a bit disappointed with the standard rss feature in Mambo as it only supports rss 0.91. Suprisingly, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a component available that outputs the content in any of the other formats so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a go. No point in reinventing the wheel so I made use of an excellent class called FeedCreator. It can output in RSS 0.91, 1.0 and 2.0 as well as OPML and ATOM 0.</description></item><item><title> UK TV Guide Component</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/uk-tv-guide-component/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2004 15:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/uk-tv-guide-component/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just completed a component for Mambo. As you can probably guess by the name, it retreives and displays the TV and Radio listings for the UK. At the moment, there is a choice of over 60 channels and two ways of displaying the listings; columns and timeline.
I spent a bit more time on the UI than normal but finally I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with it. It works using XML RPC, connecting to my service and then displaying the listings.</description></item><item><title> Get your dancing shoes on..</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/get-your-dancing-shoes-on/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2004 15:06:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/get-your-dancing-shoes-on/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using an opensource CMS application recently called Mambo.
We needed some kind of CMS for our own site and after looking around, weren&amp;rsquo;t really happy with what was out there..
The sites based on *nuke seem so chaotic. But not Mambo. The sites created with Mambo are nicely designed and user friendly. But the admin interface is absolutely brilliant! Its a well designed system with a great community. Theres quite a few templates around which quite nice to look at.</description></item></channel></rss>
