It&amp;rsquo;s been a while.
Been busy with work, life and stuff.
But feel like posting again so I&amp;rsquo;ve changed servers and got a temp design up, which will change soon.
So let&amp;rsquo;s see what happens.</description></item><item><title>Semantic Web - right now</title><link>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/semantic-web-right-now/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2005 14:25:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/semantic-web-right-now/</guid><description>A semantic interface means finding information online will be much easier as unrelated results won&amp;rsquo;t appear. Here&amp;rsquo;s a gentle intro to the semantic web.
The semantic web won&amp;rsquo;t be in wide use yet but the University of Southhampton has released an interface to a new semantic web interface called mSpace. They have an example interface searching for classical music which currently is Mozilla only. It is javascript driven and uses xmlhttprequest to retrieve the data.</description></item><item><title>A change...</title><link>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/a-change/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2005 21:44:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/a-change/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve moved my blog from Mambo to Wordpress. Mambo is a great CMS but as a blogging tool, its not quite so mature. I wanted something simple and web standards friendly and wordpress seems to be it. The casualties in this move are the comments and the uk tv guide. I&amp;rsquo;m no longer publishing the component as its a Mambo component. but head on over to SynTV for the listings. Fortunately I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged too much over and I was able to transfer over by good old cut n paste.</description></item><item><title>I'm back!</title><link>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/im-back/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2004 16:24:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/im-back/</guid><description>I knew I hadn&amp;rsquo;t posted in a while but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise it&amp;rsquo;s been almost 3 months! What have I been up to?!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of work with Mambo recently and I like the thing so much I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to be moving the backend of this blog form Movable Type to Mambo. The main reason for this is that I&amp;rsquo;ll need to put up a version of Mambo up anyway to demo the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, so I might as well use it to blog as well.</description></item><item><title> It's been a while...</title><link>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/its-been-a-while/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2004 16:24:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/its-been-a-while/</guid><description>..since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted. I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with a couple of projects and haven&amp;rsquo;t had much time. These projects were Java and PHP based with pure HTML frontends but could probably be enhanced quite nicely if using Flash. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add this to my list of things to do with Flash. Lately this list of mine is getting longer; either my creative think tank juices are overflowing or there&amp;rsquo;s never enough time.</description></item><item><title>Usability for RIAs</title><link>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/usability-for-rias/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2003 16:26:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/usability-for-rias/</guid><description>This may be a few months old but I only just discovered it. This article discusses Jakobs Nielsen 1994 usability heuristics for desktop applications with respect to Rich Internet Applications. Most of us might be used to website heuristics but RIAs are more like desktop applications and should be treated similarly and the article explains how.</description></item><item><title>A nice surprise...</title><link>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/a-nice-surprise/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2003 16:28:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/a-nice-surprise/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit busy over the last week or so and haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to do post anything or even read ppls blogs. But I had a rather pleasant surprise when I caught up on my reading and found Mario Klingmann at Quasimondo had mentioned this site on his blog! Very nice indeed! Thanks Mario&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few flash projects in the pipeline that I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to find the time to work on.</description></item><item><title>A new node is born...</title><link>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/a-new-node-is-born/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2003 16:41:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/a-new-node-is-born/</guid><description>and you&amp;rsquo;re reading its first blog. Which is nice, for me at least.
Why have I got a blog? Well, it allows me to put up anything I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on and to comment on anything I feel like commenting on&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great big message or anything like that for people. It&amp;rsquo;s just another blog from just another bloke..</description></item></channel></rss>
