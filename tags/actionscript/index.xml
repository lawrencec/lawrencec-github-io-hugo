Yet another rss app but it shows nicely the usage of various components, old and new, that 2004 offers.
It uses the Accordion and TextArea UIComponents and the XMLConnector to load the urls of the feeds to download. Flash&amp;rsquo;s css support is also demostrated within the textarea.</description></item><item><title>Design Patterns in Flash</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/design-patterns-in-flash/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2003 17:20:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/design-patterns-in-flash/</guid><description>Now Actionscript is OO, I thought it would be useful to try out implementing a design pattern in Flash. The pattern I chose is the Memento pattern, which is mainly used to implement &amp;ldquo;undo&amp;rdquo; functionality in applications. The reason I chose Memento is because its a pattern that uses interfaces and I wanted to explore this in AS 2.0. An interface is an object that defines methods but has no implementation.</description></item></channel></rss>
