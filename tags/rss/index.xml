Suprisingly, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a component available that outputs the content in any of the other formats so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a go. No point in reinventing the wheel so I made use of an excellent class called FeedCreator. It can output in RSS 0.91, 1.0 and 2.0 as well as OPML and ATOM 0.</description></item><item><title> RSS in Flash 2004</title><link>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/rss-in-flash-2004/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2003 17:10:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.nodetraveller.com/post/source/rss-in-flash-2004/</guid><description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to post anything recently but I have had time to quickly cobble together a little app using flash 2004 and its components. Yet another rss app but it shows nicely the usage of various components, old and new, that 2004 offers.
It uses the Accordion and TextArea UIComponents and the XMLConnector to load the urls of the feeds to download. Flash&amp;rsquo;s css support is also demostrated within the textarea.</description></item></channel></rss>
