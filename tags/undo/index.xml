The pattern I chose is the Memento pattern, which is mainly used to implement &amp;ldquo;undo&amp;rdquo; functionality in applications. The reason I chose Memento is because its a pattern that uses interfaces and I wanted to explore this in AS 2.0. An interface is an object that defines methods but has no implementation.</description></item></channel></rss>
