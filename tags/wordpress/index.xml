Mambo is a great CMS but as a blogging tool, its not quite so mature. I wanted something simple and web standards friendly and wordpress seems to be it. The casualties in this move are the comments and the uk tv guide. I&amp;rsquo;m no longer publishing the component as its a Mambo component. but head on over to SynTV for the listings. Fortunately I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged too much over and I was able to transfer over by good old cut n paste.</description></item></channel></rss>
